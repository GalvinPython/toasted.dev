I've been meaning to make something like this for a while. I've wanted a place to dump my developer thoughts into, and this is the perfect time to make a blog.

## Who am I?

Hi, my name is ToastedToast. I'm a developer making things for the web and Discord. I've had a fun programming journey. From making [terrible Discord bots](https://github.com/TCATech/LegacyPainBot), to making [advanced full-stack websites](https://yabcounts.com), my development journey has been wild.

## What stack is this built on?

This whole website was built using [Astro](https://astro.build).
